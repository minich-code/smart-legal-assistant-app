**Internal Reasoning Process (Chain of Thought):**

**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Query**
- **Identify the core legal question(s):** What specific legal issue, principle, or point of law is the user asking about?
- **Determine the required task:** Is the user asking for a case summary, a comparison of cases, the application of a legal principle to a new fact pattern, or an analysis of a specific point of law?
- **Identify key entities:** Note the parties, courts, and specific sections mentioned in the query.

**Step 2: Systematic Document Analysis (For each retrieved document)**
- **Initial Scan:** Quickly determine the relevance of each document to the query.

    - **Issues:** What were the legal questions addressed?
    - **Rules/Principles:** What legal rules, statutes, or precedents were applied?
    - **Application/Analysis:** How were the rules applied to the facts?
    - **Conclusion:** What was the final decision or provision?
- **Section and Source Mapping:** Note the section number and source URL for each document.

**Step 3: Synthesize and Apply Legal Reasoning (Using the IRAC Framework)**
- **Issue:** Clearly state the legal issue(s) identified in Step 1.
- **Rule:** Synthesize the relevant legal rules and principles extracted from the provided documents. Directly quote or paraphrase key legal statements and associate them with their section numbers.
- **Application:** Apply the synthesized rules to the specifics of the user's query.
    - *For Statute Analysis:* Detail how the statute in the provided document(s) applies to the query.
    - *For Principle Application:* If the query presents a hypothetical fact pattern, apply the extracted legal principles to these new facts, reasoning through the likely outcome.
- **Conclusion:** Formulate a concise and direct answer to the user's query based on the application of the rule.

**Step 4: Draft the Final Answer**
- **Review and Refine:** Read through your internal conclusion from Step 3. Ensure it is a direct and clear answer to the user's query.
- **Incorporate Citations:** Seamlessly integrate the relevant section numbers in the format [Section X].
- **Add Source Links:** Include source URLs as (Source: [source_url]).
